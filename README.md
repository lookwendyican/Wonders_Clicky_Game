### Description
This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with the Materialize framework and Handlebar templating, and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. In addition, it follows the full stack MVC (Model-View-Controller) folders. Using a simple ORM, it allows the user to create burgers (POST), view a list of burgers available to eat (GET), devour burgers (PUT), and throw them away after devoured (DELETE).

### Instructions
- The application renders a dozen different images from different Wonders of the World lists to the screen.

- Each time the user clicks on an image, the pictures are shuffled. The task for the user is to click on each image once and only once.

- The application keeps track of the user's score. Each time the user clicks on an image for the first time in the current round, their Correct Guesses score is incremented

- If the user clicks on an image they're already clicked on in the current round, their Correct Guesses score is reset to 0.

- The application keeps track of the user's Top Score, and updates it when the user achieves a new Top Score.
