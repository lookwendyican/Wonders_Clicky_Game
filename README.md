### Instructions
- The application renders a dozen different images from different Wonders of the World lists to the screen.

- Each time the user clicks on an image, the pictures are shuffled. The task for the user is to click on each image once and only once.

- The application keeps track of the user's score. Each time the user clicks on an image for the first time in the current round, their Correct Guesses score is incremented

- If the user clicks on an image they're already clicked on in the current round, their Correct Guesses score is reset to 0.

- The application keeps track of the user's Top Score, and updates it when the user achieves a new Top Score.
